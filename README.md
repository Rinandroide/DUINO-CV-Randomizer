# DUINO-CV-Randomizer

These codes are intended for beginners who interface with the DUINO module for the first time.<br>
More info about DUINO module here => http://detroitunderground.net/modular/du-ino/ <br>
Github page of the project => https://github.com/logickworkshop/du-ino <br><br>

This example consist of a very basic CV randomizer which uses GT1, GT2, GT3, GT4 as trigger inputs and CO1, CO2, CO3, CO4 as CV outputs.<br><br>

# Content description 
• The first example, called "duinoRandomizerAUDIOONLY", doesn't provide code for the graphical part but only for the Audio.<br>
• The second example, called "duinoRandomizerWITHOLED", provides a simple graphical implementation for the previous code in order to display triggers status and cv outputs value(Volts). <br>
Follow the instructions inside the codes to configure the device (Switch Configuration [^][_] ).

NB:
In both examples there's not code for the rotary encoder. It will be added as soon as possible.
